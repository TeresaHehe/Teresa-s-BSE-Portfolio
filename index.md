# Interactive Pet Planter
<!---Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:--->

| **Engineer** | **School** | **Area of Interest** | **Grade** |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Teresa W | Palo Alto High School | Electrical Engineering | Incoming Junior

<!---**Replace the BlueStamp logo below with an image of yourself and your completed project. Follow the guide [here](https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/adding-images-github-pages-site.html) if you need help.**

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone--->

<!---# First Milestone--->

For your first milestone, describe what your project is and how you plan to build it. You can include:
- An explanation about the different components of your project and how they will all integrate together
- Technical progress you've made so far
- Challenges you're facing and solving in your future milestones
- What your plan is to complete your project--->

<!---# Schematics--->
<!---Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser.--->

<!---# Code--->
<!---Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```--->

<!---# Bill of Materials--->
<!---Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Starter Project: Retro Arcade Console

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZQY198Sars?si=7Xs376vGNubwJR2j" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

  The arcade console consists of a display, a scoreboard, multiple buttons, and a buzzer. In order to run, it requires either a micro usb or AAA batteries to transmit energy to the components. The base of the console is the PCB (printed circuit board); it contains the IC (integrated circuit) chip, which runs all functions on the board. It contains three parts: diodes, transitors, and microprocessors. The diodes control the flow of current in the circuit, while the transitors act as switches that allow voltage into the circuit at a specific capacity. The microprocessors perform calculations and carry out protocols. The IC chip is connected to the ground and vcc wires, and contains many input and output channels which extend to the different parts of the console. Depending on which inputs are activated, the chip will facilitate certain outputs, which changes the behavior of the device. 

  There are multiple games available on the arcade, including tetris, snake, race cars, space invaders, and a slot machine. The four blue buttons control the direction of objects on the LED display modules, which are made of many small lights. Together, the lights flash on and off to create patterns and images. The scoreboard, a seven segment display, works in a similar fashion; it can create any combination of digits by lighting up or turning off each segment. 

![seven segement display diagram](display.png)
<font size =-3>Each segment is labelled with a letter from "a" to "g"; by turning on and off different segments, the display can show different digits.</font>
  
  When booting up the device, the player can scroll through the different game options with the directional buttons. The green button is used to select a game or perform game-specific actions, such as rotating a shape or shooting objects. The yellow button pauses the game or exits from it. Every component of the console, aside from the case and the button caps, was soldered onto the PCB. The solder acts as an adhesive and allows the wire to conduct electricity to the rest of the board.

<!---# Other Resources/Examples--->
<!---One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
